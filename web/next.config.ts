/**
 * Server-side only: the browser never learns the backend origin, it only ever calls /api on the
 * origin it was served from. Same-origin is what makes the session work — a SameSite=Lax cookie is
 * not sent on cross-site XHR, and the CSRF double-submit has to read a cookie the browser would
 * otherwise treat as third-party.
 *
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` was the setting documented and deployed before `BACKEND_ORIGIN` existed;
 * it is read here only as a fallback so already-configured deployments keep rewriting to the right
 * host after an upgrade, and it is deprecated — new configuration should set `BACKEND_ORIGIN`. A
 * variable that is set but not a valid absolute URL fails the build instead of silently falling
 * through to localhost, so a typo in production configuration cannot turn into every request
 * quietly rewriting to the frontend container itself.
