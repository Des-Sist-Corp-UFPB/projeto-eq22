// backend but never set a forwarding header themselves, so without this the backend would see
// every browser request as coming from this container.
//
// The browser is never a proxy here, so every forwarding header it sends is forged. Both forms are
// deleted before Next sees them - never merged, appended to, or passed through. ClientAddressResolver
// gives `Forwarded` priority over `X-Forwarded-For`, so leaving `Forwarded` in place would let an
// unauthenticated caller pick a fresh rate-limit bucket on every request just by varying it.
